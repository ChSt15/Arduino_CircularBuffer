# Arduino_CircularBuffer
A buffer template for arduino. Should also work with non arduino applications. 
### List of features
 - Can place or remove elements from front or back of buffer.
 - Can sort elements using mergesort.
 - Can calculate average, deviation, median of values inside buffer.
 - Supports = operator and more important [] operator to access elements like an array.
 - Supports any class types for pure fifo functions. For more advanced functions like sorting, average etc. operators +, >, <, /, sqrt() need to be implemented by class.
